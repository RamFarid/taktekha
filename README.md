# Taktekha online

Play tic-tac-toe online on Taktekha website
this is my own project full-stack all ideas from my own :innocent:, all features and logical functionalities work :dizzy: as:

- User Authentication
  - Google auth
  - Facebook auth
- Save user data as games history and games score
- Friends list

_etc..._

### Dependencies and usages:

In my inexperience as a back-end, I used `firebase` from google cloud with `React` library, also the app includes `PWA`, `serverWorkers`, and `mainfest.json` for app installability as native app.
